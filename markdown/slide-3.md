## Routes tab

In this tab we can define endpoints and responses.
We can define headers, type of responses e.g. html, text, json, or other file type. <br>
The response can be written as text or json in the editor or we can defined paths to serve files from directories. <br>
Mockoon also enables regex expressions to create complex rules with templating helpers.
